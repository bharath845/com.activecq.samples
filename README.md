# Adobe CQ Samples

ActiveCQ's com.activecq.samples is a collection of sample implemenations and stubs for common Adobe CQ implemenation pieces.

At this time the Samples do not have test coverage and should be used as simple guides to help you understand the general approach for implemenation these various modules.

The Samples also include common tasks and comments describing the role of various aspects of the implementations.
